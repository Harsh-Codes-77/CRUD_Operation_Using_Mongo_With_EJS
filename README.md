This project demonstrates a simple and efficient implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS templating. It serves as a foundational example for managing data in a web application.

**Introduction**

CRUD operations are fundamental in application development, allowing for the management of data through creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. This project provides a straightforward implementation of these operations using a combination of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS.

**Features**

Create: Add new records to the database.

Read: Retrieve and display existing records.

Update: Modify details of existing records.

Delete: Remove records from the database.

**Technologies Used**

Node.js: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): Templating engine for generating HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
